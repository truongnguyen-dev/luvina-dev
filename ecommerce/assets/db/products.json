        "description": "Since last week, Donald Trump has been announcing his planned Cabinet member nominations. Many people, including a number of Republican politicians and commentators in conservative media (including Fox News) have expressed great surprise at the lack of qualifications of most of the nominations, and some of them seem antithetical to the positions. For example, he wants former Congressman Matt Gaetz as Attorney General, even though he has been under investigation for ethics violations, soliciting prostitution, and Russia and Vladimir Putin."
